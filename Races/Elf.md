### Elf
The elves migrated to Ao from the two parallel planes to the Prime Material, the Feywild, and the Shadowfell. Why they left their own planes to reside permanently in Ao will depend on who you ask. It is a casual pastime among elven philosophers to argue the many reasons but in truth, it is simply a matter of perception. All elven societies trace their history to either the Feywild or Shadowfell.

Elves live the longest of all races, with records showing that some have lived for over 7000 years before dying due to poisoning. In effect, their bodies do not age once reaching maturity. A side effect of this is that elves are only fertile for the first 50 or so years of their life and more than half of all female elves are completely infertile. It is of great importance, therefore, for female elves to bear offspring, as many as they can. This has led to elves being a mostly matriarchal society, with fertile elven women holding positions of high rank and privilege.

Elves adore the natural world, finding peace and solace in all things natural. They have an affinity for animals, especially birds, but they are not averse to eating meat. Music is a significant part of their culture with zithers, wooden flutes, and drums being their core instruments. Elves make their home in places of natural beauty where buildings and structures can blend seamlessly with their surroundings.

Elves have an ageless structure to their face and features that is readily identifiable to almost any creature on Ao. If that were not enough, they are the only race to have pointed ears. Furthermore, elves do not grow facial hair once they come into adulthood, though, their "teen years" do allow for facial hair.

Elves have little variation in skin tone with almost all elves being fair-skinned. Their eyes are any shade of brown, blue, purple, pink, or green. Other physical attributes and some magical power inherent in elves are derived from one of two lineages.

**High Elves.** Found throughout Ao, high elves enjoy trading and working directly with others. They hold themselves lightly aloof but do not consider themselves superior to other races. High elves invariably have yellow hair ranging from a light chrysoberyl to a rich yellow-amber citrine.

**Shadow Elves.** Not nearly as common as their High Elf brethren, Shadow Elves are much less philosophical and tend to get along well with others due to their laid-back nature and zest for life. They enjoy challenges and mixing with other races. Their hair is either straight black or dark blue-black.
