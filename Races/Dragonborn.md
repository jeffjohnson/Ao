### Dragonborn
Dragonborn only recently traveled to Ao. Whether from sailing in the Astral Sea or from being lost in the Elemental Chaos, it is not known. Regardless, since their first appearance just over 1000 years ago, they have grown to become well accepted and sometimes even revered by the other races of Ao.

Dragonborn are noble and much more akin to dragons than they would ever admit. While not quite haughty, they shun weakness in any form. They are fiercely loyal to other Dragonborn, and doubly so to those who share their draconic heritage, often forgiving even the most malicious of acts. They are often reverent of dragons that share their heritage, however, they can be dangerously scornful to other dragon types. They have a great distaste for lizardfolk and the greatest insult to a Dragonborn is to confuse them with such.

Dragonborn rarely form their own communities, instead, they embed themselves among other cultures and adopt many of their customs. They often become highly defensive of their homes and will repay unkindness to their community with savage alacrity.

Dragonborn have a dragon-like appearance and are related to one type of dragon. The color of their scales and the features of their face are determined by their ancestry. They do not have wings, nor do they have tails.
