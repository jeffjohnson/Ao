### Human
Humans are the most numerous race on Ao. Their history has been written and rewritten enough times that no true source has made it through the ages. They have always been part of the world. Perhaps they are the oldest of all races, but that knowledge is far lost to the annals of time. They are the most varied of all the sentient races, with virtually all representations of hair and skin tones present among their various cultures. All humans speak common as well as a local language native to their region. It is said that historically there were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of languages spoken by humans, however now, there is only a handful. As other races came to be in Ao, the unification of humans throughout the world has brought more acceptance and tolerance among the different human cultures.

Compared to other races of Ao, humans are relatively short-lived, but they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. They build mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, achievers, and pioneers of the world. Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of their society. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, fame, influence, and by achieving great things. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.
