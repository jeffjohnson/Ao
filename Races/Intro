# Races & Legacies

The races of Ao are a reflection of both its history as well as the influx from various planes of existence. While there *is* a history of warfare between all races, tolerance has mostly won out among “civilized” societies. While many cultures still struggle with prejudices, those tend to fade as heroes rise from all races to combat evil in its many varied forms.

Playable races fall into two broad categories, races and legacies. Races are distinct in that there can be no interbreeding between them. The playable races of Ao are humans, Dragonborn, dwarves, elves, gnomes, goblins, halflings, and lizardfolk. Legacies are human characters who share some part of their ancestry with extraplanar creatures or monsters. They are compromised of cambions, changelings, genasi, nephilim, and shifters. While legacies are human, they are treated as distinct races within the game, however, all races of Ao recognize that these legacies are born from human stock.

The major nations and human ethnicities in Ao are based heavily on real-world historic and fantastic cultures. The people of Ægyptus and Stygia are based on the historic cultures found in ancient Egypt. Zyncara is based on the ancient inhabitants of the Iberian peninsula, Hybernia is based on ancient Ireland and Celtic traditions, and so forth. While those game civilizations are not exact replicas, the culture, beliefs, and art of those civilizations are used as a baseline for the fantastic world that is Ao.

In the real world, the term race can be used in such a way as to offend. It is not used in that manner here. Races represent a game concept that idealizes different mechanical benefits and the overarching history of a given group. Within each race are a myriad of cultures and subcultures, all of which cannot be accurately presented in this text. In no way are non-human races derived from or indicative of existing human cultures.
