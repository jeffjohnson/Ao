### Goblin
Goblins have found their way into modern society through sheer force of will and the willingness to do any type of job imaginable. Historically brutish and hated by the more “civilized” races, goblins slowly gained acceptance into the world via trade. Quickly the goblins found that human masters were far less oppressive and cruel than hobgoblins and bugbears and within a few hundred years had ingrained themselves into virtually all human societies. While they have yet to make inroads among other races, they are accepted by most human cultures as hard-working and easy to please. Goblins can be found throughout Ao in both the wild as well as in most human settlements.

Goblins in the wild are taught to hate their cousins who live among humans considering them weak and betrayers of the will of Maglubiyet. By contrast, city-dwelling goblins do not hate their brethren, nor are they particularly engaged in trying to convert them to their more human-centric style of life. The fewer goblins in the city, the more jobs there are to be had!

Goblin skin color is always a pallid shade of blue, green, ochre, orange, purple, and red. Green and ochre are the most common color, with other shades occurring with much less frequency. Their hair is always black with eye color of either black or brown. Goblins often group with those of like skin color, with the shade, brightness, and color having significance among the greater goblin culture.
