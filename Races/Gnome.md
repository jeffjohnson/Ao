### Gnome
Gnomish origins are the source of much speculation among the taller races. Many believe they are directly related to dwarves, a rumor that is hotly disputed by both races. While dwarves are excellent miners, smiths, and forgers of great renown, they do not have the artistic ability with jewelry that makes gnomes so well-loved among the other races. Gnomes themselves don’t know, nor do they care to know, regarding their origins. They do not tell myths or keep long histories. They don’t extol the virtues of bravery, diplomacy, leadership, or chivalry. They are, however, quite fond of practical jokes. They are excellent tricksters and are never offended by pranks pulled against them. Stories of such practical jokes are shared for generations and are the primary source of oral genealogy among family groups.

Gnomes have a great love for all gems and precious metals. Gnomes are masters of identifying, collating, and valuing all precious and semi-precious stones. They will always offer fair price for cut gems and will likewise haggle and negotiate the value of uncut stones, believing that true value can only be identified once they have gone from mere “rocks” into precious works of art.
Gnomes, much like dwarves, come in a variety of skin tones and hair tones that run the gamut of standard values. Furthermore, just as dwarves, the genetics of their parents have little to no impact on the color of their eyes, skin, or hair. Eye color for gnomes bears the same variety found in precious gemstones with the exception that there are no eyes with shades of orange and red.
