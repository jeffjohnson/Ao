### Lizardfolk
Whether from natural evolution, a creation of the gods, or from some bizarre magic, the origins of lizardfolk are even less debated or concerning to the world at large than that of gnomes. Once hunted for their skins and because of their more tribal way of life, lizardfolk have slowly gained acceptance through their incredible abilities. Many kings and emperors have found their skills invaluable. Lizardfolk are often in the military complex of nations, finding work as scouts and soldiers depending on their origin.

While lizards of all shapes and size are found in Ao, there are only five major types of lizardfolk, each of which comes from a Reptilian Origin. These origins dictate the appearance as well as the special abilities of their respective origin. The five origins are as follows:  
**Chameleon.** Able to blend into their surroundings like no other, the chameleon lizardfolk are prized allies used for scouting and infiltration.  
**Crocodilian.** Known throughout Ao as fierce warriors, the crocodilian lizardfolk have become ever-present in coastal and waterway communities as guards and escorts for trade.
Horned. The horned lizardfolk are often used as shock troops in armies. These noble warriors are able to cross vast distances on small amounts of water and use their horns in combat to great effect.  
**Iguanadae.** While not often adventurers, the Iguanadae are imposing, being some of the largest of lizardfolk. They are often temperamental, but to those with whom they have bonded, they are fiercely loyal for life.  
**Tuataran.** Ancient of both mind and body, the tuatarans were among the first lizardfolk to walk among mankind. Their connection to the primordial realm gives them almost prescient abilities at times.
