### Halfling

Halflings are a peculiar species. They are more human-like than any other species, besides humans of course. As a matter of fact, they are often mistaken for human children and can easily pass as such if they so choose. They haven’t, however, let their small stature diminish their influence for good throughout Ao. They are eternally cheerful, always fond of good ales and brews, and always looking at the positive side of life. Their very nature is one of positivity and hope. They are welcome adventurers in any party, lifting spirits and caring deeply about the welfare of those that they call friends. The family, including extended family, is central to halfling life. They congregate with other halflings in communities called shires, but are quite fond of occasional adventures. This has led to some halflings making homes throughout most human lands. They find providing the comforts of the hearth and ale to travelers and traders is a quite satisfying life.

Anyone who has spent time around halflings, and particularly halfling adventurers, has likely witnessed the storied “luck of the halflings” in action. When a halfling is in mortal danger, it seems as though an unseen force intervenes on the halfling’s behalf. Furthermore, their luck seems to extend to others around them, giving them the strength and courage to face incredible challenges.

Hair, skin, and eyes of halflings follow all the same patterns as found in humans.
