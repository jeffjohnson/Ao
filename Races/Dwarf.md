### Dwarf
Dwarves have been in Ao for as long as anyone can remember. Dwarven legend says that the first dwarves, brothers named Brokkr and Eitri ventured underground in response to the mellifluous words of Odriir, who was trapped beneath the mountain. Odriir had forgotten how to make fire, but when the brothers lit their torches in his presence he used the heat to melt the bars of mithril that bound him. In return, Odriir taught the brothers to work the metals as a gift for sharing their knowledge of fire with him and freeing him. Thus the dwarves were born.

Dwarves are a highly dedicated race, universally taught to value and treasure kin above all others. Their duty is to family, clan, race, trade, and kingdom, specifically in that order. Dwarves are welcomed to underground halls regardless of where they hail from. They lay claim to all mountains as gifts from Odriir and consider themselves mountaineers of superior skill. They are tolerant of all other races, though, not necessarily welcoming to them. They value hard work, hard drink, and hard challenges.

Dwarves have skin tones from fair to near black and everything in between. Hair color ranges from light brown to black. Their eyes are always silver, gold, or copper in color. Unlike most other races, the genetics of the parents have very little to do with the skin color of their offspring. It is quite possible that a natural child of two similarly appearing dwarves will have very different tonal attributes in skin, hair, and eye color.
